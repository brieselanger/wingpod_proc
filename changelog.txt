[2019/02/10]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- updated static defect calibration routines

[2019/01/24]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- changed directory handling: raw input files have to be put
	into the 'in/' directory. Output will be saved into
	the 'out/' directory.

- removed unused routines in flow angle calibration guide,
	still not finished

[2018/12/10]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- added .tex sources for calibration guide and presentation
- added a_priori_const.py file in calibration subdir, used
	as 'starting point' for the whole calibration process

- minor change in calibration guide (calibration-square parallel
	to main cardinal directions)
- revised static defect calibration routines

- removed unused const.py files in calibration subdir

[2018/11/26]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- added documentation (README and thesis)
- added calibration routines (not tested yet!)

- removed some unused things

[2018/10/12]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- minor fixes regarding the test routine

[2018/10/09]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- Updated test procedure so that the user can check
	the calculation results for consistency 

[2018/10/08]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- fixed a bug which occured in pandas v0.23.4

[2018/08/27]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- added constant to compensate dynamic pressure errors

- updated coefficients

[2018/08/20]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- added INS status legend in exported kml file

- changed (increased) pins density in kml file

[2018/08/15]
Changes for last commit of this date:

- fixed wind barbs showing wrong wind directions (180 deg) in exported
	kmz file
- fixed temperature and dewpoint units in exported kmz file.

- added file parser for raw data files. Pressure data files can be plotted
	to decide with ease, which files may contain actual flight data.

[2018/06/14]
Changes since last commit:

- fixed small bug in the master timestamp generation. the desired
	upsampled frequency was not equal as specified in the configuration.
- fixed missing old main.py, which wasn't updated in the last commit

[2018/06/13]
Changes since last commit:

- added calculation of meteorological values (potential temperature,
	equivalent potential temperature (also known as Theta_e),
	virtual temperature, air density)
- added calculation of indicated airspeed
- added SI converation just after raw data loading to eliminate the
	SI/non-SI mess. Configurable constants where left in userfriendly
	non-SI values, though (for example: temperature in Â°C instead of K).

- removed unused load_mevis function in the load_data.py collection

The output was tested for consistency using the proposed testdata

Known issues/to do:
- split unix timestamps somehow. After upsampling, the timestamp values are
	so big that they suffer precision losses because of limited float
	precision. This causes a very small but disturbing artificial jitter
	in the output timestamp values. One way to address this problem is to
	split the UNIX time of the reference day at 00:00 UTC and the seconds
	thereafter.

[2018/06/10]
Changes since last commit:

- added testdata files and description, contained in the ./testdata directory

[2018/05/25]
Changes since last commit:

- fixed turning rates and acceleration values which were in rad/s/sample and
  	m/s/sample for the internal IMU sampling rate (125 Hz)
- fixed sign for angular velocities
- finally added the correction constants obtained from calibration maneuvers

- some tiny syntax fixes here and there

This release is presumed to be the final version to use the windpod-proc
	package operationally.
	However, the results were'nt discussed very profoundly
	yet, therefore, the correction algorithm might change in the
	future. There is still some ucertainty, if the (measureable) static
	defect caused by flow angle deflection should be properly corrected
	and implemented.

[2018/04/23]
Changes since last commit:

- fixed path to the wind-barbs directory
- fixed and tested csv-export for processed output-data. Takes ages...but works.
- fixed the unintentionally deactivated inclusion of boom lenght in the wind
  	calculation

- added offset correction for pressure sensores in order to re-zero them
- added dynamic correction for static and dynamic pressure measurements
- added response time offset for pressure sensors
- added time range selection option in the configuration
- added output directory option for data exports

- removed AD conversation lag subtraction of pressure sensor timestamps

- some comments have been revised
- code is more consistently regarding code convetions. Not 100% hardcore
       pythonian, though.


Known issues:
- jumps in timestamps can be problematic and leed to errors in the preprocessing
  	part. This can be bypassed manually by removing timestamp jumps in raw
	data files. Keeping a consistant timestamp in raw data files saves time
	consuming manupulation of them.
- huge amounts of RAM get allocated, package may not be usable on machines with
	low end memory space (4 GB or less).
